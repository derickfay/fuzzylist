# fuzzylist
Fuzzy, self-updating list filter workflow for Alfred 3 and 4

This is a workflow template - it does nothing as is.

## Usage:
- create a csv file like you would for an [Alfred List Filter](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/list-filter/)
- name the file *list.csv* and add it to the workflow directory

On the initial run, the workflow will create a file list.json for output to the fuzzy search.  If list.csv is modified, it will update list.json .  

Instructions on how to modify the code to use multiple lists in a single workflow can be found in the [Alfred forum post](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/11094-fuzzy-self-updating-list-filter-workflow-template/?tab=comments#comment-57706)
